To build, all you need is a Java 6 compiler and Ant, properly
configured to find the Java compiler.

If you got this source code from the .jar itself, just make a src/
directory, stick the com/ directory into it, and delete all the .class
files. Then you're ready for hacking.

  unzip Chess.jar
  mkdir src
  mv com src
  find src -name "*.class" -exec rm {} \;

  # Tidy up (optional)
  rm -rf META-INF
  ant clean

  # Source control (optional)
  git init
  git add .
  git commit -m "Initial commit from .jar."

  # Test run
  ant run

If you want to use the Checkstyle target "check", you'll need to drop
a recent version of the Checkstyle -all.jar in your Ant's lib/
directory.

If you want to use the ProGuard "optimize" target, you'll need to drop
the progaurd.jar in your Ant's lib/ directory.

If you want to use the "format" target you'll need AStyle installed
somewhere on your PATH.

I like the code to pass all Checkstyle checks and be properly
formatted by the "format" target before it gets checked in. A trick
you can use for the latter if you're nervous about formatting
uncommitted code: first commit your code, format, then commit --amend.

  git commit -am "Added blah blah."
  ant format
  git diff   # check it
  git commit -a --amend
