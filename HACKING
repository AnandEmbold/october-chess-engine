To build, all you need is a Java 6 compiler and Ant, properly
configured to find the Java compiler.

If you want to use the Checkstyle target "check", you'll need to drop
a recent version of the Checkstyle -all.jar in your Ant's lib/
directory.

If you want to use the ProGuard "optimize" target, you'll need to drop
the progaurd.jar in your Ant's lib/ directory.

If you want to use the "format" target you'll need AStyle installed
somewhere on your PATH.

I like the code to pass all Checkstyle checks and be properly
formatted by the "format" target before it gets checked in. A trick
you can use for the latter if you're nervous about formatting
uncommitted code: first commit your code, format, then commit --amend.

git commit -am "Added blah blah."
ant format
git diff   # check it
git commit -a --amend
